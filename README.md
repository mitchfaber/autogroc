# Auto Groc

App created using REACT frontend, NODE backend, and MONGO for database. Bootstrap and fontawesome were used for the frontend as well. I focused more on the functionality than the design for this app. I did not move to proper GIT branching and versioning until near the end of development, as I learned more about GIT during this project. See my next project for full development using proper branching.
